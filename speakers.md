## Dr. Kayhan Batmanghelich
Dr. Kayhan Batmanghelich is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boston University. Previously, he was an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biomedical Informatics with a secondary appointment at the School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh. Before that, he was a post-doc at Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) at MIT, and worked with Prof. Polina Golland.

Dr. Kayhan has developed algorithms to analyze and understand medical images, genetic data, and other electrical health records, such as clinical reports. The main themes of research in his lab are about the main challenges of AI in healthcare: (1) Explainability, (2) Data Efficiency, (3) Multimodal Data Fusion, and Causality. His lab works on Alzheimer’s, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) projects. His research is supported by funding from NIH, NSF, and industry awards. Dr. Kayhan is the co-founder of MLxMed, a multi-campus online similar series focusing on ML methods specifically for healthcare applications. He is also the co-founder of READE.ai, a start-up about the Realtime Evaluation of Adverse Events during surgery. 


## Dr. Kun Zhang
Dr. Kun Zhang is an associate professor in the CMU philosophy department and an affiliate faculty member in the machine learning department. His research interests lie in machine learning and artificial intelligence, especially in causal discovery and causality-based learning. He develops methods for automated causal discovery from various kinds of data, investigates learning problems including transfer learning and deep learning from a causal view, and studies philosophical foundations of causation and machine learning. On the application side, he is interested in neuroscience, computational finance, and climate analysis.
